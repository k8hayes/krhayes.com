*AKA - a field ecologist discovers how heartbreaking it is to bury the enormity of work required to parameterize and benchmark a model into the supplement section of a paper*

As part of my [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2219248&HistoricalAwards=false) exploring interactions between fire and biotic disturbances in Interior Alaska, I've been parameterizing moose and hare for the model [iLand](https://iland-model.org/iLand+Hub) using the biotic disturbance model [BITE](https://iland-model.org/bite/#/). This has lead to some interesting conversations over the last few months - several unsuspecting new introductions at conferences have stared at me, slightly blankly, before asking "so, there are tiny moose in your model?"[^1]

[^1]: Reader, I would love

BITE (full name: BIotic disTurbance Engine) is a module built by the very smart Juha Honkankiemi (LUKE) and Werner Rammer (Technical University of Munich) to simulate a whole world of biotic disturbances [@honkaniemi2021]. The term "biotic disturbances" is itself, a catchall - megafauna like moose or mastodons are biotic disturbances, insects like aspen leaf miner or emerald ash borer are biotic disturbances, fungi-driven pathogens like aspen running canker are biotic disturbances. Called "agents" for short, each of these types of disturbances occur in very different numbers across very different scales - if we assume that mastodons behaved similarly to modern elephants, they might have traveled up to 35 miles within a day, while emerald ash borer are creeping across the United States at a pace of a half a mile a year (assuming they don't get into your firewood).

While a landscape model might be able to easily represent an individual mastodon roaming across a landscape, modeling each individual fungi spore across a landscape is absolutely not possible computationally. To deal with this, BITE represents agents in units of biomass. Kilograms of mastodon move across cells within the model, uprooting kilograms of trees and consuming kilograms of spruce needles before falling into kilograms of tar pits[^2].

[^2]: (technically no, though I'm sure you could overthink it and implement it as a bit)

This means you have two key decisions to make when starting to parameterize a new agent:

1.  How many are there?
2.  What do they weigh?

Answering both is complicated.

### How many moose are there?

Well, total? 2.2 million moose, according to [@moll2022]. Apparantly those 2.2 million are split pretty evenly between North America and Eurasia.

#### *Where do we get those numbers on moose density?*

It's hard to count moose. Logistically, financially, ecologically[^3].

[^3]: maybe emotionally?

Moose behavior itself makes it hard to count moose - moose use dense forest cover, they tend to avoid areas where humans are active[^4], and they're most active at dusk and dawn.

[^4]: (except for this one pictured below, who was chomping on willow in the literal driveway to Denali National Park)

More importantly, they're highly mobile - a single moose can move up to 65 miles in a day.

To adequately count moose, you need to count moose over a large area, which is expensive.

Aerial surveys are the most common method to count moose - flying a helicopter or a plane over a known area and counting the moose spotted from above. This doesn't account for the moose not spotted (an issue in wildlife ecology often referred to as "sightability"), but it still remains more cost-effective than methods like pellet surveys or camera trapping, which face the same sightability issue but typically require more resources.

An aside - climate change may make those aerial surveys more difficult. \[snow\]

See \[\@reinking2022\] for more on the important relationship between wildlife and snow and also the incredible phrasing of "snow professionals" and "snow science community"[^5].

[^5]: I love my job

You can also count moose using harvest data - hunters are required to provide data on the number of moose they harvest, and while that data certainly has some limitations[^6], it does give us a good sense year to year for the density of moose across the state.

[^6]: not everyone reports

### Okay, but K8, how many moose?

According to Alaska Fish and Game, there are an estimated 175,000 moose in Alaska. Those 175,000 are spread out in densities anywhere from 1 to 150 moose per 30 square miles[^7]. That's over the entire state however, including tundra where moose can be quite scarce.

[^7]: that's 0.003 -5 moose per square mile for those curious

Within the Interior,

All to say, we can say with some (some!) certainty that there are somewhere between XX and XX moose in Interior Alaska, about XX per acre.

The landscape I'm modeling contains the [Caribou Poker Creek Research Watershed](https://www.lter.uaf.edu/research/study-sites-cpcrw), which falls within Game Unit 20A of the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game. According to their report from XX, there were XX moose in XX year, \## male and \## female.

objective: 10-15,000 moose across population (adopted 2016)

That brings us to the second question.

### What do moose weigh?

Well, I started with the obvious route but googling *how much does a moose weigh* doesn't get you very far.

Googling "how much does a moose weigh alaska" leads to a page from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game that gives moose an average weight of 550 kilograms. They cite Bishop 1988, who puts bull moose between 540 - 680 kilograms and cows between 360 - 590 kg in Alaska.

#### Several factors influence moose body mass:

##### Weight varies latitudinally

Moose are generally largest in Alaska, and smaller further south \[\@pastor1988\].

##### Weight varies by gender

Bull moose are on average much larger than cows (CITE).

##### Weight varies by age

##### Weight varies within a season

Moose put on weight in the summer, and reach peak body mass in fall (Mautz 1978, Adamczewski et al. 1987, Schwartz et al. 1987).

#### Alaska Moose

\[\] puts the weight of an average moose at XX kilograms. \[\] points out that body mass is different between male and female moose - \[\] points out that body mass of female moose differs according to the number of calves they've produced. The number of calves they produce depends in turn on the conditions that year - was there enough food? was it warm enough?

So, if moose weight depends on the gender ratio across the population, what's the gender ratio of the moose population in Alaska? Surprisingly, we have a good grasp of this - hunting targets male moose, so populations are maintained at a level of Xx moose per in. Fish and Game reports the densities per game unit. The model landscape I use for this work falls within game unit 20A, and a 2014 report shows a ratio of
