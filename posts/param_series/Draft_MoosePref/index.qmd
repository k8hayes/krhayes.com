What do moose eat?
As part of my series on Model Parameterization, I'm 

Deciding what an average moose weighs for the purpose of the model is one thing, deciding what species preferences to select turned out to be another 
Moose browse differently in different seasons:

In Alaska, moose avoid thinleaf alder (Alnus tenuifolia) and prefer to browse on willow (Salix spp: Wolf & Zasada 1979; McAvinchey, 1991) - Suominen, Danell and Bryant 1999

The Willow Question
Right now, willow is not parameterized in iLand. Species parameterization for trees can be an undertaking, and it's an active conflict / bit in our lab wherein some of us think it makes sense to parameterize willow, and some of us do not.
