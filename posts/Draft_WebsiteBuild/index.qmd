There's tons of resources out there for how to built a personal website as an academic, made by folks with actual expertise in web design, coding, etc.

I'd wanted to start my own blog / [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) for years. Initially, the roadblock was imposter syndrome - did I actually have anything to write about? Would it be useful to anyone? isn't it all a bit cringe?[^1]

[^1]: Counterpoints:

    1.  I've never suffered from a lack of opinions
    2.  writing is useful to me so it doesn't really matter if it's useful to anyone else
    3.  cringe isn't real

Once those worries were ~~shouted down~~ overcome, the main roadblock became technical know-how. I originally developed my website using a bundle of tools including blogdown, github, netlify all centered around the very popular academic theme from hugo. I've had it for years now, but it was heavy-lifting - building it took what felt like a week of work back in 2020, and I couldn't update easily without having to relearn the folder structure rules each time.

Originally, I wanted to tweak the theme, add some blog pages and be done with it, but writeups like [this](https://masalmon.eu/2020/02/29/hugo-maintenance/) from Maelle Salmon discussing hugo theme maintenance and this [one](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/) from Alison Hill on Quarto made me wonder if there was a better way.

The straw that broke the camel's back was ~~vanity~~ the [Tufte theme](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-gallery/page-layout/tufte.html) that's possible in Quarto - per the requirements of receiving a degree in geography, my copy of *Visual Display of Quantitative Information* lives on my coffee table. Adding Tufte's beautiful sidenotes and column spacing is as easy as adding a line or two of yaml in Quarto and opens up a whole new world of snarky asides[^2].

### Personal Website Development 101

"*Have a personal website*" is advice you run into over and over when thinking about a scientific career. In my experience, that advice started and stopped there. Which is too bad, since questions like *What do I put on my website*? *How do I build one*? *How much time should I sink into this*? are the start of some potentially really interesting conversations.

Briefly[^3], I think the logic behind the advice "Have a website" is usually that websites make you findable. In the grand tradition of lagging behind every other field, academia doesn't typically use LinkedIn in any deep way and alternatives like ResearchGate or Academy haven't seemed to take off. So, a biographic / personal website can be a straightforward way to establish your web presence in science (or, at a minimum, make you slightly more google-able)[^4].

[^3]: lol

[^4]: there are so many Kate/Katherine Hayeses and they all seem to have gotten into life coaching lately

My two cents is that the easiest way to answer the questions: *What do I put on my website*? *How do I build one*? *How much time should I sink into this*? is to figure out your ultimate objective first.

I know that sounds obtuse: Kate, you just said prevailing advice is to have a website, isn't having the website the objective?

Sure, but what do you want to get out of having a website? Is it checking the box so you can move on with your life / science? Do you want to connect with other scientists in your field? Is it an exercise in coding?

No wrong answers here, but if you're hoping to check the box and get the hell off of social media[^5], then it should shape how you build one and how much time you want to put in. If it works to have your website be a living CV, it might be worth finding a squarespace / weebly / etc platform where you can fill in the basic info, get a domain name and call it a day.

[^5]: good on you

For me, drafting a website was originally an exercise to get more comfortable with Github. I had had some exposure, but didn't use it consistently in my workflow and didn't really have any collaborators that used it. Using repositories to host a website seemed like a quick way to get a bunch more experience with version control. Hence my excuse to ~~procrastinate~~ **take the long way round**, instead of turning towards more pre-packaged templates.

When I first drafted my website as a ~~sophisticated procrastination technique~~ **savy professional development exercise** during my PhD, it was pretty sparse. I had my basic affiliation, interests, education information, a PDF copy of my CV and links to my other online presences (ie, my google scholar profile, my github and my now mostly obsolete twitter profile). Out of imposter syndrome/FOMO, I added a Publications page and a Project page since I'd seen those on other people's websites, but I'm not sure either added anything in retrospect.

But, I'd always been interested in expanding it. As a remote postdoc who works from home, I'd like more ways to interact with other scientists, and while it's probably presumptuous to assume any of this will be read at all, writing for even an imaginary audience has been a great way to write more day to day. Hence, blog.

## Switching from blogdown to quarto

### Initiating a quarto website

Initiating a Quarto website is shockingly easy. Working from Rstudio, you simply open a **New Project**, select **Quarto Website**, name it something new and click **Render** to preview.

Your Rstudio will look like this:

![a brand new quarto website](images/NewWebsite.png){fig-alt="An empty brand new quarto website" fig-align="center"}

And your render will look like this:

![off to the races](images/Render.png)

That's it. 4 steps, and you're previewing a website with a landing page, a menu bar and two pages. Now, your render won't be hosted anywhere but locally, but already that's a much more easy entry than the one I remember from Hugo.

### To add a blog:

To add a blog[^6], or any pages that will live under a different landing page than the home page, add the following steps:

[^6]: You can also create a "Quarto Blog" instead of "Quarto Website" by going to New Project - I just wanted to figure out how to do it by hand so I knew how to initiate other website pages down the line

#### Create a landing page

-   Initiate a quarto file for your landing page and call it something like **blog.qmd**

-   Within blog.qmd, add the following lines to the yaml code at the top:

``` yml
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  categories: true
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
```

Now, you'll need to add it to your site navigation:

-   Navigate to your **\_quarto.yml** file which should have been created when you initiated the New Website process above

-   You should see yml code - mine looks like the following:

``` yml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Katherine Hayes"
  navbar:
    right:
      - text: "About Me"
        file: about.qmd
    
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: false

editor: visual
```

-   Under navbar, add lines that specify text and file similar to the example above (so, probably *text: "Blog"* and *file: blog.qmd*)

-   Create a folder called **posts** - your posts will live here, within individual folders

-   Within **posts**, each folder will contain an index.qmd file for the blog post

#### Writing a blog post

#### How to make a Series

To publish blog posts in a series, they need to be located in a subdirectory of the **posts** folder. You'll also need a landing page. I'm writing up a series of posts on some of the model parameterization work I've done recently for my fire-herbivory project, so I named my series folder **posts/param_series** and added a landing page named **param_landing.gmd** (I know, creative). Make sure the landing page is located in the top directory, the one where your about / index / blog quarto documents are located.

Within the landing page,

``` yml
title: "Series: ggplot2-tips"
listing:
  contents: posts/ggplot2-tips
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  categories: false
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
  fields: [date, title, reading-time, description]
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: true
```

You'll need to modify the **contents:** setting within your blog.qmd file so it sees the contents of the series folder. You can do this using [glob syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/globs.html) - a very fun name for what essentially means "global patterns". \*\* can be used to tell quarto to look within any folder, and \*.qmd will select any quarto document.

Thus, you can then change your blog yml from:

``` yml
title: "Blog"
subtitle: "An attempt at a digital garden / notebook"
listing:
  contents: posts
```

To this:

``` yml
title: "Blog"
subtitle: "An attempt at a digital garden / notebook"
listing:
  contents: 
  - posts/**/*.qmd
  - posts/**/**/*.qmd
```

And it should catch any quarto documents within the nested folders.

## Switching netlify hosts

My old website was already hosted on Netlify, and I wanted to hold on to the same domain.

Initially, I started my Quarto website in a folder adjacent to the folder containing my existing website. When it came time to migrate, I copied my old website folders into an archive, and then replaced them with the new quarto folders (keeping the same Rproj file). Then I held my breath and pushed changes.

After that, I needed to mollify Netlify - I disconnected

# Some other unsorted tricks

The following is mostly for my own reference, so proceed with care. If you're curious about anything else on this site, the full code is available in my [corresponding github repository](https://github.com/k8hayes/krhayes.com).

## draft: false - Publishing posts

I ran into some trouble at first with *draft: true* - once you've added it to the the yml code at the top of your quarto document, you'll need to delete it entirely to get the post show up once you're ready to publish.

## Adding pictures to the background of title blocks

## Setting global blog post theme

You can use the **\_metadata.yml** file to set options for all the files in the **posts** folder.

Mine looks like this:

``` yaml
# freeze computational output
# (see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)
freeze: true

# Enable banner style title blocks
title-block-banner: true

# Default for Tufte Style
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-title: Contents
    toc-location: left
    grid:
      margin-width: 350px
reference-location: margin
citation-location: margin

# Adding comment sections
comments: 
  utterances: 
    repo:  k8hayes/BlogComments
```

## New Post Template

To make starting new posts easy, I added a folder to my posts folder called **NewPostTemplate** - the index file within has the following settings:

``` {.yaml .yml .yml}
---
title: "New Post Title"
subtitle: "New Post Subtitle"
date: today
categories: []
date-modified: last-modified
draft: true
---
```

Then, I can simply make a copy of that folder to start a new post. Make sure to update the date to the publication date once it's finalized - using *today* and *last-modified* in the internal workings of the quarto document is not really considered best practice, since it means more rendering in the background ([per the Quarto documentation)](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).

## Adding Comment Sections

I'm still figuring out how to add comments to the blog. There appears to be

## Setting Tufte Theme

To use a Tufte-style theme in the blog posts, I've added the following code to my \_metadata.yml file within the posts folder:

`{# Default for Tufte Style} format:   html:     toc: true     toc-title: Contents     toc-location: left     grid:       margin-width: 350px reference-location: margin citation-location: margin`

## Packaging data for blog posts

I tend to work with some large files, and work across multiple desktops. In order to pull in data for individual blog posts, I've been playing with using **save.image()** to collect all the files in an analysis, and save an .RData file in a folder I can reference from the blog quarto document.

One quirk I haven't sorted out yet - **save.image()** doesn't save SpatRaster objects. Not sure how to deal with this yet.
