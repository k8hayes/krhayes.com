  <title>Alaska National Wildlife Refuge Boundaries</title>
  <abstract>The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of December 2, 1980 (Public Law 96-487) established sixteen National Wildlife Refuges within the state of Alaska, USA. The external boundaries of these Refuges were defined in the Federal Register on February 24, 1983 in Part 3, Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska, Description of Boundaries, pages 7890-7936. These external boundaries, as depicted in this data layer, encompass Federal, State of Alaska, and private lands and waters.
The external Refuge boundaries shown here were digitized by, and are actively maintained by, the USFWS Alaska Region Division of Realty. As such, this data layer is the authoritative source for the boundaries of the National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. 
These boundaries were digitized using the following data sources:
Federal Register legal descriptions (February 24, 1983)
U.S. Geological Survey 1:63,360 topographic maps (produced from aerial photos taken in the 1950s and 1960s)
ESRI World Imagery (compiled from satellite imagery obtained from ~2010 to the current date)
The boundaries were first digitized in the mid-1990s by cross-referencing Federal Register legal descriptions to the USGS topographic maps. Digitizing was done on-screen at a zoomed-in scale of ~1:10,000 or larger. As high-resolution satellite imagery (ESRI World Imagery) has become available, the Division of Realty has been updating the 1:63,360 topographic map-based boundaries to conform to the more current satellite imagery. This work is ongoing and is not yet complete for all sixteen Refuges.
Boundary Modifications/Improvements
May, 2019: Adjusted the Arctic Ocean coastal boundary of Arctic NWR to match 30-meter resolution IFSAR data that was provided to FWS by BLM. The exact source date of the IFSAR data is not known, but it was acquired sometime during 2019.
April, 2020: Adjusted the coastal portion of the Becharof NWR boundary to match the coastline as shown in the ESRI World Imagery.
June 28, 2022: Adjusted the western section of the Tetlin NWR boundary to conform to the eastern boundary of the Tetlin Indian Reservation as shown by the Bureau of Land Management's survey of USS 2547.
April 25, 2024: Adjusted a portion of the shared Izembek/Alaska Peninsula refuge boundary on the west side of Cold Bay, and northwest of the village of Cold Bay, to coincide with the boundary of Air Navigation Site 176 as constructed by using the National Geodetic Survey's 1976 adjusted NAD27 coordinates for the original COW 1923 benchmark.
May 16, 2024: Adjusted the boundary of the Alaska Maritime NWR - Womens Bay Unit to conform to the Bureau of Land Management's survey of USS 2539, and to follow the approximate lime of mean high tide as shown in ESRI's World Imagery dataset.

This data layer displays the external boundaries of the sixteen National Wildlife Refuges in the state of Alaska, USA, as defined by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, and as codified in the Federal Register of February 24, 1983.
