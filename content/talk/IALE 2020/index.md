abstract: Increases in fire frequency and intensity in Boreal Interior Alaska have led to shifts in successional trajectories in black spruce (Picea mariana) dominated communities. Short-interval fires (< 15 years) specifically disfavor local black spruce populations immediately post-fire but the longevity of resulting emergent deciduous communities remains to be seen. Herbivory is one of several factors that can influence long-term post-fire successional trajectories of black spruce stands in Interior Alaska after the initial disturbance - browsing by moose or snowshoe hare can suppress regeneration of black spruce, particularly in stands dominated by a deciduous overstory. What remains unclear however, is the role of moose and hare browsing on emerging deciduous communities specifically in reburned stands (whether conifer or deciduous). Understanding and predicting future successional trends in the boreal requires a functional understanding of the effect of moose and hare herbivory on both black spruce and deciduous recruitment, growth rates and survival. To investigate the interaction of herbivory pressure and short-interval reburning, we evaluated browse intensity, herbivore presence and browsing preference in (originally) black spruce stands that have burned in one, two or three short intervals in two locations of Interior Alaska. We compared the effect of herbivore pressure of both moose and hare on tree, sapling and seedling species presence, density and abundance in reburned stands. We present initial results of browse intensity, herbivore presence and browsing preference and the results of the modeled effect of herbivore pressure on regenerating reburn communities. This work will help inform landscape-scale predictions of future successional trajectories within reburned Boreal Interior Alaska and add to our understanding of the interaction between disturbances and herbivore pressure in forested ecosystems.
