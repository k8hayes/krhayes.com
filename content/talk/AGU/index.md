abstract: Warming temperatures in the boreal have been linked to increased frequency and severity of wildfires, and time intervals between fires have decreased from 50-100 years to 10-15 years within the last three decades in some areas. Shortening fire intervals have been shown to drive changes in successional pathways in boreal forests via seedbank limitation, but the role of variability in topography in promoting successional divergence remains unclear. While postfire succession in upland boreal black spruce forests is well understood, the effect of varying topography on the impact of multiple short-interval fires remains unclear. To investigate how landscape variability alters postfire successional trajectories under shortening fire intervals, we established plots across a mosaic of fire histories (1-3 fires in 70 years) in two sites in Interior Alaska with differing hydrology. We compared regeneration of conifers, deciduous trees and shrubs, and graminoids as well as soil carbon and nitrogen across unburned controls and stands experiencing one, two or three fires in 15-year intervals in an upland site (drier) and a lowland site (wetter). All stands were originally dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana), and at both sites, black spruce regeneration was significantly lower following three fires, compared to unburned stands and stands burned once. In the wetter lowland site, less organic soil was consumed by fire and presence of black spruce persisted until two fires, indicating local topography may initially drive successional divergence via differences in substrate consumption. Deciduous regeneration differed between two sites after three fires, with paper birch (Betula neoalaskana) dominating in upland sites and willow (Salix spp.) and aspen (Populus tremuloides) in lowlands. Results of this study offer strong empirical evidence of the divergence of boreal successional trajectories from previous historic norms and indicate the importance of examining the role of spatial heterogeneity on the impact of multiple disturbances.
