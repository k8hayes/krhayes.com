My project "Evaluating Flammability of Reburns in the Boreal Forests of Interior Alaska" was selected for funding this week! The award will allow us to travel back up to Alaska this summer, where we'll look at how an increase in forest fires may or may not lead to sustained changes in landscape flammability.
