Hi! I'm Kate. I'm a PhD student in the Biology department at the University of Colorado Denver. I work in the intersection of paleoecology, landscape and disturbance ecology, studying how ecosystems change over time and space. 

Right now, I'm interested in how increasing forest fires are changing Alaska's boreal forests, and what that means for the rest of us.
