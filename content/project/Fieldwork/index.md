Fieldwork in ecology and other field-based natural sciences is critical to completing graduate programs successfully and requires a variety of skills, from scientific to interpersonal. Graduate students are often responsible for organizing, leading and managing their own fieldwork and field crews, but few resources exist for those entering graduate schools without past experience. 

I'm leading a project that starts to fill that gap. We've compiled a survey to collect generalized advice, strategies and resources, aimed particularly at supporting graduate students with the interpersonal and leadership skills required to complete fieldwork successfully.

Our project website is [here](https://gradfieldwork.com/). Our survey, if you're interested, is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK_a9pzVJugJG6WBuc5BNwW1gxLOW6ENKdG2oAT0KSLgR8fw/viewform).
