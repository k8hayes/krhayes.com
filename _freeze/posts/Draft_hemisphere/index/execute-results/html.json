I don't have a background in community ecology, but have been working with a labmate and friend to understand the impact of reburning on the communities we measured. As part of that effort, I've been curious about light availability - the reburned stands I worked in as a PhD became more and more open with more reburning, and presumably that means more light would reach the understory.\n\nIn order to capture the light coming through the canopy in these sites, there was a moment in our sampling protocol where we set up a camera with a fisheye lens on a flat surface in the middle of the plot, laid down on our backs trying to hid in the vegetation around us, and looked up at the sky.[^1]\n\n[^1]: My favorite part of sampling, for the record.\n\n![We weren't always able to sneak out of the frame successfully, peep my trusty field hat at the top](images/outtake.JPG)\n\nTo convert pictures like these into measurements of the light coming through the canopy, I've been exploring how to use the *hemispheR* package in R.\n\n# Introduction to hemispheR\n\n*hemispheR* was built to help process digital hemispherical photography (DHP) [@hemispheR]. It calculates leaf area index, a ratio of total leaf area of vegetation to the surface area grown, using equations predicting the relationship between the surface area of leaves and the fraction of light they intercept.\n\nWhile leaf area index is really useful, I'm mostly interested in light availability more broadly - I'm really just looking for the fraction of canopy to open sky. *hemispheR* classifies pixels within an image as either canopy or sky as a step to calculating leaf area index, so it should work great for this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nI'll start by importing one of our canopy photos. Here's the image:\n\n![This is a picture from one of our mature plots - note the black spruce all around the edges of the photo.](images/11_0.JPG)\n\n*import_fisheye()* imports the photo as a raster, defining the edges of the picture.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nph11_0 <- import_fisheye(filename = \"/Users/katherinehayes/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-k8rhayes@gmail.com/My Drive/Work/Website/krhayes.com/posts/Draft_hemisphere/images/11_0.JPG\",\n                       circular = TRUE, display = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nIt is a circular fisheye, where xc, yc and radius are 2456, 1632, 1630\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/importing 11_0-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing *binarize_fisheye()*, I can classify the pixels as either canopy (0) or sky (1).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nph11_0bin <- binarize_fisheye(ph11_0)\n\nplot(ph11_0bin)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/11_0 binarize-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThen, I'll convert the raster into a data.frame so I can calculate the percent of open sky:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nph11_0data <- as.data.frame(ph11_0bin) # 0 is canopy # 1 is sky\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat percent is sky?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nround(length(which(ph11_0data == 1)) / nrow(ph11_0data) * 100, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 19.58\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, I'll compare that to a picture from one of our thrice-burned plots.

How can we fix that?\n\nOne option is zones - setting zonal = **TRUE** in *binarize_fisheye()* tells the function to split the image into four zones, calculating each separately. Let's try it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nph23_3bin <- binarize_fisheye(ph23_3, zonal = TRUE, display = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/23_3 binarize zones-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's a lot better, but still not perfect.

How similar are those metrics?\n\n[^2]: essentially the strength of the sun in a given location, measured in watts per square meter.
