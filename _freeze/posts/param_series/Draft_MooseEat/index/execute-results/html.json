The authors use two methods for estimating dry matter consumption: the ratio technique (fecal excretion vs the indigestibility of the diet) and the bite-count approach (measuring bite rate, simulated bite size and total foraging time). Summer consumption was 129 grams per kg of body weightˆ0.75 (per month I think), mid-winter dropped to 38 grams / kg BMˆ0.75 (again, per month?).\n\nTable of moose intake results\n\n```         \n- penned Alaska moose (Schwartz et al. 1981)\n\n- penned and wild younger moose on Isle Royale (Miquelle 1979)\n```\n\n[@renecker1985] - Summer consumption was 129 grams per kg of body weightˆ0.75 (per month I think), mid-winter dropped to 38 grams / kg BMˆ0.75 (again, per month?).\n\n\\- average daily consumption in mid-july = 9,938 (SD 836) grams\n\n\\- net energy requirement for maintaining free-range \\[\\[moose\\]\\] cows = 399 KJ / kg of BMˆ\n\n[@mcart2009]\n\n\\## Takeaways\n\n\\- summer dietary nitrogen availability is a nutrient constraint on moose\n\n\\- Denali cows were simulated to gain 4-6% of body mass across the summer\n\n\\- moose reach peak body mass in fall (Mautz 1978, Adamczewski et al. 1987, Schwartz et al. 1987)\n\n```         \n- reproductive success linked to august body mass (Cameron et al. 1993, Schwartz and Hundertmark 1993, Cameron and Ver Hoef 1994, Barrett 1982)\n```\n\n# More resources\n\n## References\n\n## Session Info\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nR version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Sonoma 14.0\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: America/Chicago\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.3.3    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.2        \n [5] tools_4.3.3       htmltools_0.5.8   yaml_2.3.8        rmarkdown_2.26   \n [9] knitr_1.45        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.43         digest_0.6.35    \n[13] rlang_1.1.3       evaluate_0.23    \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
