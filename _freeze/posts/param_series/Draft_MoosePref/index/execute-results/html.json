As part of my [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2219248&HistoricalAwards=false), I'm using the landscape model [iLand](https://iland-model.org/iLand+Hub) and the biotic disturbance model [BITE](https://iland-model.org/bite/#/) to examine how herbivores might mediate the effects of fire in Alaskan Forests. Part one (linked here) covered my sidequest to determine what to set as the average weight of moose in the model, as derailed by immediately realizing it was a much longer question.\n\nHere, we'll cover an additional suspiciously-simple question: **what do moose eat?**\n\n## How BITE represents foraging\n\nTo capture herbivore impacts in iLand, we need to give them some forage preferences in BITE. BITE, designed to represent many different types of biotic disturbances, is pretty flexible with input. The following is the main information we'll need to provide:\n\n-   What are the basic characteristics of hosts?\n\n    -   Which species, trees vs saplings, any filters on height/density/etc?\n\n-   What do agents target?\n\n    -   Do they target specific compartments of the tree? options: foliage, stem, branch, root\n    -   Do they have preferences?\n    -   What fraction of trees / saplings die?\n\n# What do moose eat?\n\nThe short answer is mostly willow, birch and aspen [@seaton2011].\n\nThe longer answer[^1] is **it depends**.\n\n[^1]: you knew this was coming, there wouldn't be a blog post if there wasn't one\n\nIt depends on a few factors:\n\n## Moose diet depends on the season\n\nMoose prefer high forage quality (ie, very digestible) in summer months and avoid lignified stems until after leaf fall in autumn (Renecker and Hudson 1986, Renecker and Hudson 1988, Schwatz et al. 1984).\n\nSpecifically, birch leaves are considered important summer forage (Mathisen et al. 2017). Most browsing occurs in winter (\\[\\[Mathisen et al. 2017\\]\\]), when moose target \\[\\[willow\\]\\] (\\[\\[Seaton et al. 2011\\]\\]) and sometimes \\[\\[birch\\]\\] (Bryant & Kuropat 1980).\n\n## Moose diet depends on the quantity and quality of forage\n\nMoose browse selectively, particularly if \\[\\[forage quality\\]\\] and quantity is high (Vivas and Saether 1987, Saether and Anderson 1990). Thus, \\[\\[moose\\]\\] very rarely eat spruce (Shipley et al. 1998, BergstrÃ¶m and Hjeljord 1987). In a study of moose browse in early postfire stands, \\[\\[Maccracken and Viereck 1990\\]\\] found that moose browsed \\[\\[willow\\]\\] the most, followed by \\[\\[birch\\]\\] then \\[\\[aspen\\]\\].\n\n\\> In Alaska, moose avoid thinleaf alder (Alnus tenuifolia) and prefer to browse on willow (Salix spp: Wolf & Zasada 1979; McAvinchey, 1991) - Suominen, Danell and Bryant 1999\n\n### Moose diet may depend on burn history\n\nSo, how do you set moose preferences in a landscape model that doesn't include seasons, forage quality or forage quantity? (not even really a rhetorical question, if you have suggestions, please email!)\n\nThis has been my approach: have moose target primarily aspen and birch.\n\n## The Willow Question\n\nRight now, willow is not parameterized in iLand. Species parameterization for trees can be an undertaking, and it's an active conflict / bit in our lab wherein some of us think it makes sense to parameterize willow, and some of us do not.\n\n# More resources\n\n## References\n\n## Session Info\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nR version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Sonoma 14.0\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.3.3    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.2        \n [5] tools_4.3.3       htmltools_0.5.8   rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.26    knitr_1.45        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.43        \n[13] digest_0.6.35     rlang_1.1.3       evaluate_0.23    \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
