Initially, the roadblock was imposter syndrome - did I actually have anything to write about? Would it be useful to anyone? isn't it all a bit cringe?[^1]\n\n[^1]: Counterpoints:\n\n    1.  I've never suffered from a lack of opinions\n    2.  writing is useful to me so it doesn't really matter if it's useful to anyone else\n    3.  cringe isn't real\n\nOnce those worries were ~~shouted down~~ overcome, the main roadblock became technical know-how. I originally developed my website using a bundle of tools including blogdown, github, netlify all centered around the very popular academic theme from hugo. I've had it for years now, but it was heavy-lifting - building it took what felt like a week of work back in 2020, and I couldn't update easily without having to relearn the folder structure rules each time.\n\nOriginally, I wanted to tweak the theme, add some blog pages and be done with it, but writeups like [this](https://masalmon.eu/2020/02/29/hugo-maintenance/) from Maelle Salmon discussing hugo theme maintenance and this [one](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/) from Arielle on Quarto made me wonder if there was a better way.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was ~~vanity~~ the [Tufte theme](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-gallery/page-layout/tufte.html) that's possible in Quarto - per the requirements of receiving a degree in geography, my copy of *Visual Display of Quantitative Information* lives on my coffee table. Adding Tufte's beautiful sidenotes and column spacing is as easy as adding a line or two of yaml in Quarto and opens up a whole new world of snarky asides[^2].\n\n[^2]: See: this entire writeup\n\n### Personal Website Development 101\n\n\"*Have a personal website*\" is advice you run into over and over when thinking about a scientific career. In my experience, that advice started and stopped there. Which is too bad, since questions like *What do I put on my website*? *How do I build one*? *How much time should I sink into this*? are the start of some potentially really interesting conversations.\n\nBriefly[^3], I think the logic behind the advice \"Have a website\" is usually that websites make you findable. In the grand tradition of lagging behind every other field, academia doesn't typically use LinkedIn in any deep way and alternatives like ResearchGate or Academy haven't seemed to take off. So, a biographic / personal website can be a straightforward way to establish your web presence in science (or, at a minimum, make you slightly more google-able)[^4].\n\n[^3]: lol\n\n[^4]: there are so many Kate/Katherine Hayeses and they all seem to have gotten into life coaching lately\n\nMy two cents is that the easiest way to answer the questions: *What do I put on my website*? *How do I build one*? *How much time should I sink into this*? is to figure out your ultimate objective first.\n\nI know that sounds obtuse: Kate, you just said prevailing advice is to have a website, isn't having the website the objective?\n\nSure, but what do you want to get out of having a website? Is it checking the box so you can move on with your life / science? Do you want to connect with other scientists in your field? Is it an exercise in coding?\n\nNo wrong answers here, but if you're hoping to check the box and get the hell off of social media[^5], then it should shape how you build one and how much time you want to put in. If it works to have your website be a living CV, it might be worth finding a squarespace / weebly / etc platform where you can fill in the basic info, get a domain name and call it a day.\n\n[^5]: good on you\n\nFor me, drafting a website was originally an exercise to get more comfortable with Github. I had had some exposure, but didn't use it consistently in my workflow and didn't really have any collaborators that used it. Using repositories to host a website seemed like a quick way to get a bunch more experience with version control. Hence my excuse to ~~procrastinate~~ take the long way round, instead of turning towards more pre-packaged templates.\n\nWhen I first drafted my website as a ~~sophisticated procrastination technique~~ savy professional development exercise during my PhD, it was pretty sparse. I had my basic affiliation, interests, education information, a PDF copy of my CV and links to my other online presences (ie, my google scholar profile, my github and my now mostly obsolete twitter profile). Out of imposter syndrome/FOMO, I added a Publications page and a Project page, but I'm not sure either added anything in retrospect.\n\nBut, I'd always been interested in expanding it. As a remote postdoc who works from home, I'd like more ways to interact with other scientists, and while it's probably presumptuous to assume any of this will be read at all, writing for even an imaginary audience has been a great way to write more day to day. Hence, blog.\n\n## Switching from blogdown to quarto\n\n### Initiating a quarto website\n\nInitiating a Quarto website is shockingly easy. Working from Rstudio, you simply open a **New Project**, select **Quarto Website**, name it something new and click **Render** to preview.\n\nYour Rstudio will look like this:\n\n![a brand new quarto website](images/NewWebsite.png){fig-alt=\"An empty brand new quarto website\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nAnd your render will look like this:\n\n![off to the races](images/Render.png)\n\nThat's it. 4 steps, and you're previewing a website with a landing page, a menu bar and two pages. Now, your render won't be hosted anywhere but locally, but already that's a much more easy entry than the one I remember from Hugo.\n\n### To add a blog:\n\nTo add a blog[^6], or any pages that will live under a different landing page than the home page, add the following steps:\n\n[^6]: You can also create a \"Quarto Blog\" instead of \"Quarto Website\" by going to New Project - I just wanted to figure out how to do it by hand so I knew how to initiate other website pages down the line\n\n#### Create a landing page\n\n-   Initiate a quarto file for your landing page and call it something like **blog.qmd**\n\n-   Within blog.qmd, add the following lines to the yaml code at the top:\n\n```         \nlisting:\n  contents: posts\n  sort: \"date desc\"\n  type: default\n  categories: true\n  sort-ui: false\n  filter-ui: false\n```\n\nNow, you'll need to add it to your site navigation:\n\n-   Navigate to your \\_quarto.yml file which should have been created when you initiated the New Website process above\n\n-   You should see yml code - mine looks like the following:\n\n```         \nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Katherine Hayes\"\n  navbar:\n    right:\n      - text: \"About Me\"\n        file: about.qmd\n    \nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: false\n\neditor: visual\n```\n\n-   Under navbar, add lines that specify text and file similar to the example above (so, probably *text: \"Blog\"* and *file: blog.qmd*)\n\n-   Create a folder called **posts** - your posts will live here, within individual folders\n\n#### Writing a blog post\n\n#### How to make a Series\n\n### Switching netlify hosts\n\nMy old website was already hosted on Netlify, and I wanted to hold on to the same domain.\n\nInitially, I started my Quarto website in a folder adjacent to the folder containing my existing website. When it came time to migrate, I copied my old website folders into an archive, and then replaced them with the new quarto folders (keeping the same Rproj file). Then I held my breath and pushed changes.\n\nAfter that, I needed to mollify Netlify - I disconnected\n\n# Some other unsorted tricks\n\n## draft: false - Publishing posts\n\nI ran into some trouble at first with draft: true - once you've added it to the the yml code at the top of your quarto document, you'll need to delete it entirely to get the post show up once you're ready to publish.\n\n## Adding pictures to the background of title blocks\n\n## Setting global blog post theme\n\nYou can use the \\_metadata.yml file to set options for all the files in the posts folder.\n\nMine looks like this:\n\n```         \n# freeze computational output\n# (see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)\nfreeze: true\n\n# Enable banner style title blocks\ntitle-block-banner: true\n\n# Default for Tufte Style\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-title: Contents\n    toc-location: left\n    grid:\n      margin-width: 350px\nreference-location: margin\ncitation-location: margin\n\n# Adding comment sections\ncomments: \n  utterances: \n    repo:  k8hayes/BlogComments\n```\n\n## New Post Template\n\nTo make starting new posts easy, I added a folder to my posts folder called **NewPostTemplate** - the index file within has the following settings:\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"New Post Title\"\nsubtitle: \"New Post Subtitle\"\ndate: today\ncategories: []\ndate-modified: last-modified\ndraft: true\n---\n```\n\nThen, I can simply make a copy of that folder to start a new post. Make sure to update the date to the publication date - using *today* and *last-modified* in the internal workings of the quarto document means more rendering in the background (cite where I found that tip).\n\n## Adding Comment Sections\n\n# A non-exhaustive list of Quarto resources I found useful\n\nother resources\n\n-   https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/#playing-around\n\n## Session info\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nR version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Sonoma 14.0\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: America/Chicago\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.3.3    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.2        \n [5] tools_4.3.3       htmltools_0.5.8   rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.26    knitr_1.45        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.43        \n[13] digest_0.6.35     rlang_1.1.3       evaluate_0.23    \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
