# What is github?

-   Github is a **version control system**
    -   originally built to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects

# the carrots of version control

-   no more infinite file names

-   complete record of every change you make

-   automatic back up of your work

-   work across home computer and terminator

#

# the glazed, fancy carrot of version control

-   makes data and code more available
-   develop packages
-   host websites

# the stick of version control

-   initial investment required
-   git is not that intuitive

# Some definitions

-   **Git** = software that records changes to a set of files

-   **Github** = hosting service, git-aware home for repositories

-   **Github Desktop** = app that interfaces with Github (not required but can be helpful)

-   **Repository / repo** = set of files

    -   \^ highly suggest 1 per project

# Github lore

-   **Git** built out of spite in 5 days
-   by Linus Torvald, after his free license to BitKeeper (alternative) was revoked

# What does github do?

-   manage the evolution of a set of files (called a **repository**) in a sane, highly structured way

-   while not originally developed for data science, great for the collection of files that make up a project

    -   data, figures, code, etc

# interfacing with github

-   can do:
    -   through command line
    -   apps like **RStudio**, **VScode**, **Github Desktop**

# how does github change your workflow?

-   instead of saving a new version with initials / dates, make a **commit**

    -   takes snapshot of all the files in the entire project

# Comitting changes

-   committing gives you the opportunity to describe your changes

# then what?

-   **Push** commits to github periodically to keep everything in sync

-   **Pull** updates from github to receive commits made elsewhere

    -   (github will require you to pull before you can push)

# Cut down on angst

-   probably don't bother working in the command line

-   write descriptive commits

-   push / pull regularly

-   no one is giving out git style points - if you're stuck, you don't get extra credit for getting unstuck elegantly

-   you can ignore local files within a repository (and you'll need to if they're too large to add to github)
