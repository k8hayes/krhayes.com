    "text": "As a forest and ecosystem ecologist, I work in the intersection of paleoecology, landscape ecology and disturbance ecology, using field, lab, and modeling tools. My research is driven by three underlying questions:\n\nHow do changing disturbance regimes alter forest structure and function?\nHow can historical and paleoecologic data be integrated with modeling to anticipate future change?\nWhat are the implications of human interventions in changing disturbance regimes?\n\nTo answer those questions, I work across a variety of systems, timescales and disciplines.\n\nHow do changing disturbance regimes alter forest structure and function?\nBoreal forest fire frequency has increased in recent decades, causing fire return intervals in some regions to decline from 75-300 years to 30 years or less. Untangling the impact of shorter fire return intervals in boreal forests is critical for anticipating implications for global carbon cycling: shorter intervals between fires disadvantage slower-growing serotinous conifer species but those same conifers produce thick soil organic layers that insulate carbon-rich permafrost. During my PhD, I investigated how short-interval fires altered forest composition, forest carbon and forest structure in boreal Interior Alaska. I quantified forest regeneration in stands that burned once, twice, or three times within 30 years or less, the first empirical study of boreal forests that have experienced three short-interval fires. I demonstrated that reburns drive shifts in forest composition from conifer to deciduous, even in previously-resilient forest types (Hayes and Buma 2021) and showed that reburning leads to losses in soil carbon that offset gains made from faster-growing deciduous species (Hayes et al., in revision at Global Change Biology).\nWhile studying carbon in boreal forests, I started to wonder about the effects of heavy browsing by moose and hare, and the extreme mortality caused by pests and pathogens like aspen leaf miner and canker. I was awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship to investigate how emerging biotic disturbances like herbivores and insect outbreaks interact with increasing fire frequency to shape ecosystem structure and function in high-latitude forests. Warming temperatures increase the distribution and abundance of biotic agents like aspen leaf miner and canker. Yet relatively little is known about their impact on forest structure and function, particularly when they interact with fire or intense browsing by mammalian herbivores. These disturbances and their interactions could fundamentally alter boreal forests. Working with collaborators at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and the University of Saskatchewan, I combine landscape simulation modeling with existing empirical data to test mechanistic hypotheses about fire-biotic interactions and their impact on boreal forest succession and carbon. I work with groups like the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program to synthesize existing spatial and non-spatial datasets on biotic disturbances and model how organisms like moose, hare, aspen leaf miner and others alter forest composition and carbon through interactions with fire and warming climate.\n\n\nHow can historical and paleoecologic data be integrated with modeling to anticipate future change?\nIncreasing fire is driving transformations of boreal forest composition from conifer to broadleaf species. Paleoecologic data hints at the presence of self-regulation, negative feedbacks to fire, a process enabled by an increased dominance of broadleaf species, historically considered less flammable. But it remains unclear whether paleoecologic environments are good analogs for current boreal forests, and whether shifts in forest structure and composition will enable different fire behavior under increasing temperatures. Working with collaborators at the Environmental Defense Fund, Colorado State University, and the University of Montana, I pair empirical measurements of forest structure and composition with late Holocene pollen and charcoal records from lake sediments to test for the possibility, strength or duration of fire self-regulation via increased broadleaf species. As a co-PI on the project, I lead our field measurements, quantifying forest structure and composition in broadleaf stands in boreal forests, data that will be coupled with state-of-the-art physics-based combustion models to examine potential fire behavior (more project details here). Our preliminary fire behavior modeling work has shown that fire spread in reburned landscapes is limited by both fuel and fire weather constraints (link to MS), at least within the first several decades after fire (Buma et al. 2022). \nIn addition to my ecological research, I’m very interested in how we do science. While mentoring field assistants as a graduate student, I became passionate about issues of safety and diversity in field research, particularly for early-career scientists. I believe conducting and leading fieldwork is part of the ‘hidden curriculum’ of many natural science programs – field research is a critical part of completing many natural science degrees, but opportunities for developing the leadership and management skills required to lead field research safely are limited and often informal (Reichenborn et al. 2024). I developed a survey, asking the natural science community for their perception of the key skills required to lead a field season safely and responsibly. Using the recommendations provided, my colleagues and I produced suggestions for graduate students who lead fieldwork. We also provided suggestions for ways that principal investigators, labs and departments could support graduate fieldwork, including more formal training in skills like wilderness first aid, bystander intervention and conflict resolution (Hayes et al. 2022).\nIf you’re interested in hearing me talk more about my work, I’ve given public seminars at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem studies (link seminar here).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBuma, B., K.

Those two metrics are distinct in slight yet important ways - a fire might kill all trees in a young stand but if the trees themselves were small, the impact on basal area won’t be terribly large. Or, a fire might kill only the largest/oldest individuals in a stand, thus impacting carbon greatly in a way that wouldn’t show up using just proportion of trees killed. Here, since we’re interested in how forests are regenerating, we’ll focus on instances where fires killed all trees, but I’ll show both for the sake of it.\n\n# drop the fire years where there was no burn\n  fire &lt;- fire[fire$area_m2 &gt; 0,] # no fire years with no burn\n  length(unique(fire$fireId)) # how many fires occurred across the simulation?\n\n\n  fire &lt;- fire %&gt;% \n    mutate( # how many trees were killed?\n              prop.dens.killed = n_trees_died / n_trees, \n            # what basal area was killed?\n              prop.ba.killed = basalArea_died / basalArea_total) \n      \n      fire$prop.ba.killed[fire$basalArea_total == 0] &lt;- 0 # set to 0\n      fire$prop.dens.killed[fire$n_trees == 0] &lt;- 0\n\nHowever, there’s one challenge with this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice neither metric shows values that are completely equal to 100%. At first this seems like a problem, right?1\n1 none of our fires were stand-replacing??This is an important nuance of the iLand fire output - n_trees_killed and basalArea_died are aggregated across the entire fire. Cells within the fire may have experienced full canopy mortality, but since we’re working with averages, it’ll be very very rare (if not impossible) for a stand to have 100% of stems killed across the entire fire."

    "text": "Saving additional fire output\nWe’ll need more detail, and thankfully there’s a fun way to solve this - by adding a javascript file to the scripts folder, you can add code that tells iLand to save raster files of the perimeter of each fire with additional information. Some options of things to turn on include:\n\ncrownKill: fraction of the crown killed within a burned resource unit (see wildfire ).\ndiedStemsFrac: fraction of killed trees within a burned resource unit\ndiedBasalArea: basal area (sum over resource units) of burnt trees.\nKBDI: Keetch Byram Drought Index (see wildfire ).\nbaseIgnition: base probability of an annual fire ignition event for a cell on RU level (depending on fire-return-interval and average fire size)\nfuel: burned fuel (forest floor + dwd) kg/ha\ncombustibleFuel: “available combustible fuel (current KBDI, forest floor + dwd) kg/ha\nnFire: cumulative count of fire events on a resource unit2\nlastFireYear: simulation year of the last fire event on a RU\n\n2 Breaking the forth wall: discovered this output while putting together this quarto document. In future runs, I’ll turn this on and avoid some of the steps described later in the document to filter out reburns3 Note that this is trees killed within burned resource units, not saplings. It still works for our purposes for a few reasons:\n\nThe likelihood that saplings survive in a burned resource unit where all trees are killed seems low (but we can go ahead and check later on)\nSince I’m interested in height-growth relationships, I’ll be filtering out saplings with ages older than the time since fire for the resource unit, so we should catch any that slip through (again, even if they do)\n\nFor this analysis, we’ll stick to diedStemsFrac - the number of trees killed within a resource unit3. First, you need to add a function into your iLand model to tell it to save the extra output.\nThe code to do so is the following:\n\nfunction afterFireProcessing() {\n   var praefix = Globals.year;\n   var pid= Fire.id;\n   // save the form of the fire in ESRI raster format\n   // save a file for each fire\n   Fire.grid(\"diedStemsFrac\").save('output/dead/dead_'+ pid +'.txt')\n}\n\nAdd this in to a javascript file within the Scripts folder in your iLand folder ecosystem, and enable &lt;management&gt; under &lt;/model&gt; in your project file. Now, if you set up a “dead” folder in your output, a raster of values of stems killed will save after each fire.4\n4 To track other items from the list of variables above, call a new Fire.grid() within the afterFireProcessing function and give it a unique save destinationIn order to filter our sapling output by the cells that experienced canopy-replacing fire, we can filter not only by the rasters (the footprint of the fire), but by the value of diedStemsFraction variable within each raster pixel (which represent resource units in the iLand landscape).\nThen, load the fire perimeters into R:\n\n# stacking fire spread files\n      path = \"D:/workspace/Kate/iland/model/output/dead/snapshot42\"\n      fire_maps = rast(list.files(path, full.names = T))\n\nThe function rast() from the terra package (Hijmans 2023) creates a SpatRaster object, a object type in R that can represent multi-layer or multi-variable raster data. Here, the object fire_maps we just created is a three-dimensional raster - the first two dimensions are the x and y axis of our iLand landscape and the third dimension is 27 layers of fire perimeters (one for each fire within the simulation). Each pixel within that raster represents an individual resource unit from the iLand landscape and contains a value from 0 -1, representing diedStemsFrac.\n\nHijmans, Robert J. 2023. “Terra: Spatial Data Analysis.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=terra.\n\nfire_maps \n\nnlyr(fire_maps) # 27 layers, one for each fire\n\nknitr::kable(head(values(fire_maps)))\n\nWe can call on each of those 27 layers to examine the fire perimeters one by one. For example, this is the fire perimeter from the first fire in the simulation:\n\n\n\nWe’ll use these rasters to determine which resource units experienced stand-replacing fire5, and use those resource unit IDs to filter the sapling and tree data.\n5 Which we can now define more specifically as diedStemFrac = 1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAn aside: this run is a spin-up simulation - I ran iLand, initializing forests from an empty landscape6 in year 0, and simulated forest growth and fire over 300 years. This seems to be the sweet spot for simulation runs - at year 300, we have a landscape full of a mix of mature, regenerating and recently burned stands, just as we’d observe in real life. Since fires that occur early in the spin-up inherently burn young stands, it’s not terribly representative of the relationship between height and age in regrowth that we want to eventually compare to the herbivore-impacted relationship. So, we’ll filter to just the last 100 years of the simulation.\n\n\n6 An aside to the aside (meta!!) - it’s an empty landscape in the sense that there are no trees in year 0, but we do initialize using a soil organic layer that varies heterogeneously across the landscape. This isn’t just to represent real life for real life’s sake - initializing from truly empty (truly bare ground) causes totally different patterns of forests. As has been shown in decades of work in Alaska by Jill Johnstone and others, soil organic layer filters forest community composition in really critical ways, allowing spruce to outcompete species like birch and aspen which can’t persist in thick soil or moss layers for as long.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nQuestion: what determines the initial heterogeneity in the SOL when initiating from bare ground using the permafrost module? (technically it’s the moss layer heterogeneity in year 0 that introduces the SOL heterogeneity in year 1 - where do those initial values come from?)\n\n\n\n  # filtering to last 100 years of fire\n  fire100 &lt;- fire %&gt;%\n    filter(year &gt;200)\n  length(unique(fire100$fireId)) # How many fires in the last 100 years?\n  \n  # dropping layers from fire raster\n  fire_maps100 &lt;- subset(fire_maps, \n                         paste0(\"dead_\", fire100$fireId))"

We’ll need to figure out where the overlaps actually occur, so we can exclude the corresponding resource units from the sapling and tree data later. I’ll do this process in two ways: 1) by looking at the physical overlap between the entirety of the fire perimeters, 2) by looking only at the overlap between high severity fires.\n8 Typically, “short-interval” fire in the boreal is defined as 50 years or less between fires (Buma et al. 2022). Since I’m looking across a window of 100 years, I’m assuming everything that reburns in that 100 years is “short-interval” - I haven’t looked to see if there’s resource units that burn in year 1 and reburn in year 99, and maybe I’ll do that down the line, but right now I don’t want to bother.\nBuma, B., K. Hayes, S. Weiss, and M.

Now, if we set all the values of the layers to 1, we’ll end up with a raster of number of fires.\n\nperim &lt;- fire_maps100 &gt; 0 # exclude unburned values\n\n# setting all values to 1 regardless of diedStemFrac\nperim &lt;- subst(perim, TRUE, 1, others = NA) # everything else NA\n\n\n# split all the layers into a list\nperimList &lt;- terra::split(perim, 1:nlyr(perim))\n\n# turn list into SpatRaster Collection\nperimSPC &lt;- terra::sprc(perimList) \n\n# merge values across layers\nnFire &lt;- terra::mosaic(perimSPC, fun = \"sum\")\nplot(nFire)\n\nyay!!

I don’t remember if we tested the sensitivity of our analysis to that threshold - I’m super curious how those percentages would change if we filtered to just the cells marked as high severity by MTBS.\nI don’t remember off the top of my head how we dealt with Ecoregion / what Ecoregion CPCRW would fall into.\n\n\n?(caption)\n\nAgain, the reburn frequency in the 100 year interval of iLand is the following:\n\n\n\n\n?(caption)\n\nSo, lower percentages than we see in the MTBS data.\nAn obviously incomplete spitball list of reasons reburning could be lower in iLand:\n\niLand is super stochastic? - runs vary from simulation to simulation. I can try replicating this simulation a few hundred times and averaging fire frequency across them all to see if the distribution of reburning becomes more similar to what we observe in MTBS\nUncertainty in MTBS?\nMechanisms that drive fire in iLand underestimate reburning?"
