    "text": "AKA - a field ecologist discovers how heartbreaking it is to bury the enormity of work required to parameterize and benchmark a model into the supplement section of a paper\nAs part of my NSF postdoctoral fellowship exploring interactions between fire and biotic disturbances in Interior Alaska, I’ve spent a lot of my time in the last year parameterizing moose and hare for the model iLand using the biotic disturbance model BITE. This has lead to some interesting conversations over the last few months - several unsuspecting new introductions at conferences have stared at me, slightly blankly, before asking “so, there are tiny moose in your model?”1\n1 Reader, I would love\nHonkaniemi, Juha, Werner Rammer, and Rupert Seidl. 2021. “From Mycelia to Mastodons  A General Approach for Simulating Biotic Disturbances in Forest Ecosystems.” Environmental Modelling & Software 138 (April): 104977. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.104977.\nBITE (full name: BIotic disTurbance Engine) is a module built by the very smart Juha Honkankiemi (LUKE) and Werner Rammer (Technical University of Munich) to simulate a whole world of biotic disturbances (Honkaniemi, Rammer, and Seidl 2021). The term “biotic disturbances” is itself, a catchall - megafauna like moose or mastodons are biotic disturbances, insects like aspen leaf miner or emerald ash borer are biotic disturbances, fungi like running canker or XX are biotic disturbances. Called “agents” for short, each of these types of biotic disturbances occur in very different numbers across very different scales - if we assume that mastodons behaved similarly to modern elephants, they might have traveled up to 35 miles within a day, while emerald ash borer are creeping across the United States at a pace of a half a mile a year (assuming they don’t get into your firewood).\nWhile a landscape model might be able to easily represent an individual mastodon roaming across a landscape, modeling each individual fungi spore across a landscape is absolutely not possible computationally. To deal with this, BITE represents agents in units of biomass. Kilograms of mastodon move across cells within the model, uprooting kilograms of trees and consuming kilograms of spruce needles before falling into kilograms of tar pits2.\n2 (technically no, though I’m sure if you thought too hard about it, you could add a raster of tar pits into the model)This means you have two key decisions to make when starting to parameterize a new agent:\n\nHow many are there?\nWhat do they weigh?\n\nLike so many things in science, answering those questions is way more complicated than I’d expected.\n\n\nBecause moose are so incredibly important for Alaska3, we have a surprisingly good grasp on their numbers - hunting keeps populations steady at about XX moose per ha in different regions.
